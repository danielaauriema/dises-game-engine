Delphi Platform Game Engine Library

This is my Delphi Game Engine.

It's a Borland Package Library to share common game components between projects.

It was first released in 2008 and it don't uses GPU and other advanced graphical resources.

The main objective of this project is simulate basic game input, simple physics concepts like gravity, acceleration and colision, the basic game loop, a sample tile map editor, sprite animations and so on using a double frame buffer to render the graphical interface.


I really love Delphi and this project was a big challenge to me because it was built using an AMD 450MHz processor with few computer resources but the final result was very good.

I'm not the best graphical designer and you can see all components running together in my sample project called Danyz 1.0 beta in the link below:
